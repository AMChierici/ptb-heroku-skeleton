Q,A
Hi.,Hi!
What's your name?,My name is Margarita.
Nice to meet you,And what's your name?
I'm Fadhl.,Nice to meet you too
Where Are you from.,I'm from Moldova that small country in Eastern Europe.
OK. What does it border?,Moldova's borders are Romania and Ukraine and sandwiched. It's landlocked.
"Yeah, OK, OK. What can I ask you about?","You can ask me about my passions, my family, my career plans,... Anything."
What's your favorite book?,"My favorite book is probably ""Bargaining for advantage"". hum.. I'm bad with names so good I remember that. But it is basically a book that talks about how to protect your interests when you talk to somebody while still leaving the other person happy. So basically getting what you want while actually satisfying the other person as well and building relationships."
"Is not like ""the art of the deal""... that Trump book?",It could be but I feel like the Trump book could be more about tricks things. You know this book is more about it's more psychology based so that you actually understand why you're doing so that you don't have one set way of acting in a specific situation but so that you can tailor any moment to anything just based on understanding what the other people are feeling and what you want.
What would you study?,I'm a music major and economics minor.
I think I was the one bothering you about the music at the students session. So you're a graduating student.,Yes I'm a senior now. I'm working on my capstone.
What instrument do you like? What instruments? Do you sing?,"I play the piano and the little bit of ukulele and cello and I've been playing flute for a year. I do sing but mostly in music I am... I consider myself a composer and a sound engineers as well so making it both both songs, lyrics and music, and making music for film."
"I see you already talked about your capstone, so I might ask you about something else.",You can ask me about my capstone.
"Yeah, I'm actually curious. What Are you doing?",So my capstone will be about me composing a piece of music that combines elements of Romanian Folk Music and Russian-step.
"Wow, OK. Romania I guess is close to Moldova?",Moldova borders Romania and Ukraine. And Moldova... We used to be part of Romania before it was also colonized by Russia and then we got united back to Romania and then was kind of the Soviet Union. So now we do speak both Romanian and Russian.
Ok. Those are the two main languages there.,Exactly.
I really like that ... one Song .. is it Romanian Folk Song? Is it The Bartok?,Oh yeah.
OK... What Else can I ask you about?,You can ask me about my favorite food or my friends or my family.
OK. What's your favorite food?,"I think my favorite food is... hum... I like smoothies. That's not really favorite food. I can eat anything. I've actually been recently thinking of how to eat a balanced diet so whatever I take from the dining hall is going to be 25 percent carbs, 25 percent protein and 60 percent veggies."
How do you measure?,It is by eye. You see the proportion of food on the plate.
Do they mark everything?,They don't.
"So, OK, tell me about your family. How many s.. Do you have siblings?",Sooo... my family consists of four people. Me my mom my dad and an older brother. And yes I have a sibling. He's five years older than me and he is a computer scientist and he is still in Moldova.
Is he married?,My brother?
Yeah. Do you have like... little nephews and nieces..?,My brother isn't married yet. He has a girlfriend for about two years. Let's see what has happens.
How's like in Moldova in terms of family? Like do you have a lot of cousins?,I feel like the previous generations would have way more kids. I have some cousins not that many because they're all older than me so it doesn't... I don't see them that much. But the families are quite conservative still.
"Conservative you mean... Conservatism like big size, kind of like marry early? What do you mean conservative?",I would you say a bit less conservative than that. Conservative in a way that you have to marry. Basically the goal of life. Maybe you can marry later on depends on the family again. My family's for example is encouraging me to first work on my career and then marry but they definitely want me to marry and I have a little bit more of liberal view of thinking you know that my goal in life is to be of use to the world and find happiness for myself and not necessarily marry and marriage be just a great bonus if it works out. But the family does not understand that they'll be very sad if they don't get married.
Are you religious?,I used to be. My family is religious. They are Christian Orthodox and all of them still believe and I am departed of this since I was 13. I am a little bit more agnostic as I'm sure there's some bigger.. Higher being. There's something we don't understand. But I just disagree. I refuse to believe in religious books because I believe that's just people who wrote them.
What happened when you were 13 that made you...,Puberty! Hu.. I had some friends who were also kind of going through the same stage. I was going I was in a class and a lot of progressive students. They were quite smart. We were tested when we were young... were selected.
OK. Did you went to a special school?,Mmh my school... I went to a francophone school which means that everything was taught in French. That was an experiment that started the year I had to go to school. My parents decided to try it out. So we had to be tested to know if we really will be able to handle it. And so many of the students as well were going through the stage or they were questioning religion as well. And that kind of affected me too. But I was always a rebel. 1) Self-event connection: Describing how an event (change of schools) influenced value system; 2) Current Disposition: describing current self 
Do you ever think that you might go back to being or do you practice any sort of religious rituals or things like that?,"Of course. So those are two questions - do I think I would ever go back? Maybe of course that's always a possibility. If I discover a religion that I feel very close to. Cause right now I kind of describe myself as an optimistic nihilist. Like ""nothing matters!"" But I'm happy about that! But you can do anything cause in the end.. You know what I mean. But I also, hum... I do pray sometimes if I feel like it or sometimes if I visit a church or a mosque I feel so at peace. I love all those rituals I feel I feel there is something in it. I just don't believe that is word for word what books say you know what I mean?"
"Yes, absolutely. Most people back home are Orthodox?","We do have mostly Christian Orthodox but there's also Protestants and Seventh Day Adventists and there is ... There's some, Yes. We don't really have Muslims. We don't have Buddhism, we don't have Hindu, we don't have much of that. And not even many Catholics. Just like Christian Orthodox, some Protestants."
"OK. What do you want to do after you're finished? Do you wanna go back... Well, yeah.",When I'm finished with what?
With the university. What would you want to after you finish with the university?,"I am thinking to either go to grad school, do a master's degree or get a job in consulting or get a job in the music industry as a composer or sound engineer."
Is there a specific place you want to be afterwards?,I would rather not answer that question because I am a bit superstitious about things. If I say the exact city of my plans. But if that works out I'll let you know for sure. I don't even tell my closest friends sometimes.
What else can I ask you?,You can ask me about sports that I like. Or you can ask me about...
Do you have another passion that's other than music?,"I feel like you could say doodling. I dodle, I make intricate drawings. I am also very into mathematics. I didn't do much of it in college but I was always good at it and I loved it so I'm kind of sad. And I also love people. I Feel like maybe I have some interpersonal skills that have to utilized. But I really love socializing."
"OK, hum...",What about you?
Are you allowed to ask me questions?,What's my passion? I don't know.. I like Language.
I like languages as well. How many languages do you speak?,I speak five languages.
French I'm guessing.,Yes.
And...?,"I speak Romanian, Russian, French, Spanish and English."
OK. How did you learn Spanish?,I was studying abroad in Buenos Aires on third semester and Spanish is quite close to Romanian roots. It's a Latin language. So I picked it up with live with people who don't speak English at all. And is very into learning it. With Domingo and my classes. So I learned that semester.
Is it true that for example - I guess this would apply to Romanians or maybe. But is it true that you guys can understand Italian but Italians can't understand you?,Not necessarily. We. We do find many similarities in the language. I do recall parts of the sentence but it's not like I can understand what they're saying. Are still different languages but I can kind of get a feeling of what they're talking about.
"OK, interesting.",Same as this. As somebody tried to tell me something in Chinese then I would not have even a feeling neither from information niether from body language neither... But here everything is like I have a hint at everything.
So if you traveled a lot?,"After becoming a student at NYUAD, yes. I've traveled quite a bit."
What are some of your favorite places?,My favorite place ever is New York. I hope to get back there at some point. I just love how vibrant the city is and there's always something to do and people are not overly polite. But they're not even as rude as people say. Like if you like Eastern Europe is way colder as a person than people in New York I feel it's the best mix of politeness and leaving you alone.
Have you ever been to like third world countries?,Hum... Can You give me examples of third world?
I don't know… Have you ever been to non-Western countries?,The thing is Moldova is the poorest country in Europe. Our GDP per capita is smaller than Nepal. So you could say that I am from a hardcore developing country and I lived most of my life there. So my grandma doesn't even have a toilet. Just go Behind the house and I'm so comfortable with that. If I was ever to become rich and then lose everything I wouldn't be even close to depressed because I know what it's like to start from nothing. So I'm lucky you could say. Biographical background informing current opinion about the self. 
"Yeah, that's facinating. So no toilet in your granny house?","Haha! Exactly, you heard me well."
Yaah... did you... was there water?,We installed it like five years ago. We have sold our way to... Like their spring. We would have to gather water from the spring. And now we installed like... We made it well and put a system that would pump out the water.
It's the same in my grandma's village.,Yeah? We're so similar!
"Haha, well, it was very nice meeting you, and talk to you",Thank you! It was nice to talk to you.
Hopefully we can do this again. OK,OK. Thank so much!
Bye!,Goodbye!
