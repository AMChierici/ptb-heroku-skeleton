Q,A
Hello.,Hi.
Are you a students here?,Where here?
At NYU.,So I'm a student at NYU Abu Dhabi. I'm a senior.
What do you study?,I study music and economics. I'm a music major economics minor and in music I do mostly composition and sound engineering.
What's your favorite kind of music.,I love all types of music. I feel like it depends on the piece. I love dubstep. I love electronic music. I also like ballads like the music that I write usually comes out very sad and romantic and pop song. So the music I write and the music and listen to are quite different.
Who are your favorite musicians.,I like Hoosers. I like quite a few of them but I have a weakness. I'm bad with names so even my favorite is like the favorite music. I don't always pay attention to who made it which is kind of ridiculous. We don't really buy albums ever of the same artist. I only find songs that ...
Yes interesting. You're also taking economics. Is that another interest of yours? Or ...?,So economics is my minor. It would have been originally a double major. But I did not have time to complete everything so I had to choose. But I mainly did economics because first of all I wanted to have a plan B. And second of all I always loved mathematics so it seemed natural that my Plan B could be something lucrative and that involves my passion.
Are there any other interests outside those two? Music and economics.,I love drawing sometimes but abstract basically that link. I loved volleyball and biking a lot and I am very interested in negotiation as a science and the aspects of communication.
So how long have we been in the UAE?,So I have been here since four years ago but not all the time. If you put all the time together it's probably less than two years because of study abroad.
So you were never here originally. Wher are you originally?,So I'm originally from Moldova which is an Eastern European country. It's in Romania and Ukraine and I've lived most of my life there.
You visited other countries other than the UAE and Moldova?,Yes. I've actually had an exchange year abroad before Abu Dhabi. I've been... I lived in Wisconsin for a year and after studying at NYU Abu Dhabi I got a chance to study abroad in Buenosaires and New York for a semester each and then I did a month in Paris and a month in Shanghai.
Which one's your favorite or most memorable I guess?,My favorite place ever is New York. I just see myself see the future there but I never actually think of myself as finding one place and living there all my life. I feel like I would never be able to live more than 10 years and simply.
10 years is still a long time I guess.,Yeah. But not for all. Traditionally No ... People live their whole lives in the same place.
What about New York that just stands up for you?,I feel like New York is very vibrant. Everything is happening there. It's the hub of music both the music industry and the finance world. Exactly and just I love the architecture. It's very it's quite futuristic even though it's some people might say it's dirty in some places but I love that it's always awake and people aren't overly polite nor actually overly rude because Eastern Europeans are quite cold in general. So I felt like it was the great balance and many many people and so many diverse people and some the languages and so many cultures.
So what else can I ask you about?,So you can ask me about my family or my career plans or the sports that I like or anything.
So your career plans. What do you plan doing after graduating? What is plan A?,I'm thinking of either doing a masters degree or applying for jobs for consulting. I'm applying right now and I'm also thinking of getting maybe a job composing music and being a sound engineer. But that's my third preference.
And your graduate degree would be in music or economics.,I'm hoping to get an MBA.
I mean you could combine both I guess. What do you think about doing both at the same time?,I think the MBA would give me a chance to do anything I want in the future. Because I just specialize into a field in music and I've done some economics as well. So I feel like I have enough quantitative knowledge to jump into an MBA but also it will help me use my music knowledge into creating maybe a business or solidify the music industry of Moldova.
Or creating your own productions to do...,Exactly I could do anything.
Tell me about your family? Do you have any siblings?,So my family consists of four people. It's my mom my dad and my brother and my brother is five years older and he is a computer scientist and he's in Moldova right now.
Are any of your family also interested in music as well.,"Not exactly, none of my parents like ... or do anything in music per se. They had some musical education but not much. And my my dad's kinda in the law that all my mom's a doctor my dad my brother doing CS and I just basically the broad thing of the family. I'm very interested in negotiating."
You said your brother is CS. Is he a programmer? Or is he more on the academic side?,My brother's a software developer. He was like 30 and I was 8. He was already creating software for me to cheat on Web sites of games have the highest score. So it kind of started there and every year something else would come up that I need help with and he would help me out.
Would you say you discovered electronic music production or something though him or was it something on your own?,He doesn't actually like music as heavy as I do. I always loved music and it kind of went into this uniqueness of all these things.
It was nice meeting you.,It was so nice to meet you too! Thank you for talking to me!
