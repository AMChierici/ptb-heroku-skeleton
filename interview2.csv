Q,A
So my name's Salam. I work in the computational linguistics lab in the computer science. And I'm going to ask you some questions today to get to know you.,Nice to meet you.
Thank you. So what's your name?,I Am Margarita Bichec.
Nice to meet you.,Nice to meet you too.
Do you study here.,I go to NYU Abu Dhabi.
OK.,What about you?
I finish my studies but I work here.,OK.
Yes. Where where are you from?,I am from Moldova. It's a small country in Eastern Europe between Romania and Ukraine.
"OK, nice. How long have you been here?",I've been here for four years. This is my senior year.
It's nice. What was your major?,I Study music and economics. So in music and study composition and technology and economics is just my minor.
Oh that's nice.,Thank you!
So Have you had any programming courses.,I took one Intro to Computer Science class. I studied a little bit of Python and that was great but I had to pass fail the class because I wasn't doing as great as I thought I would. My brother's a computer scientist as well.
That's nice. So I think that you have infused programming in your... I don't know - New projects throughout since you studied music technology composition.,I have used the programming in the way that I used python for one of my business classes is Negotiating because I would have to negotiate deals with people and I would have to manipulate big numbers right away and I did not have time for that. So I created my own calculator from Python that would do that for me.
Oh that's impressive.,Thank you.
So are you... Did you start your Capstone?,So my capstone ... I started my capstone since the beginning of fall and it is... it will be about combining Romanian music with Dutch music composing both and combining them.
I was about to ask are you going to use any of your cultural background in your capstone. .. What about languages? How many languages speak?,I speak five languages. So my first language is Romanian and Russian. And then I learned French and English at school and recently learned Spanish.
"Oh, nice. Have You learned Arabic?",I did not have time to learn Arabic. It's a beautiful language and I wish I studied it.
Indeed. And what do you think of Arabic music?,I think Arabic music is very intricate and it sounds exotic to me... Because I do not know that much about us but I think it is very rich and beautiful.
OK. And what you want to do after you graduate?,After I graduate. I have many different plans either to continue my studies at grad school and get my masters degree or go into consulting or get a job in the music industry hopefully composition and technology.
And what would you do if you work in the consulting industry.,I would just do whatever that job is supposed to do... I would be solving problems of other companies. I like consulting particularly because I love interacting with people and I have very problem solving oriented mindset and I love helping out so I feel like it would be a good match for me even though focused on music until now.
That's nice.,Thank you.
And what master would you get if you go into grad school.,I was thinking of getting an MBA - Masters of Business Administration - so I could combine my music and econ knowledge and hopefully restructure the music industry of Moldova in the future. So an MBA would help me a lot.
That's nice. So are you planning to go to grad school back in Moldova? If you go.,I'm planning to go to grad school in New York with the only grad school I'm applying and I do not see my future in Moldova. I see myself maybe passing through from time to time to see my family and friends but I would rather bring my family my small family out of four people with me abroad than have to come back home.
It's nice. What else can I ask you about?,You can ask me about my family or about my passions. Anything you want.
Do you have siblings who study in New York or Abu Dhabi?,"I have a sibling. He is five years older, Iulio. He is a computer scientist and he lives in Moldova and he É a few É in Moldova."
OK. And I assume the others are younger than you.,I only have one sibling.
"Oh okay, sorry..",No worries... What about you?
My siblings?,Sure!
I have two siblings a brother and sister.,That's cool.
Yes. So have you been to different places in the UAE?,I have been to only Abu Dabi and Dubai.
All thos four years?,I wish I could see more places but I'm not too crazy of visiting places for a brief period of time. I prefer that if I go somewhere that I spend at least half a year there or at least a month and so I am not quite passionate about short trips because they exhaust me so I guess. I don't hate them. I don't have the initiative to do it.
So where did you go for your study away semester?,For my study aways I've been to Buenos Aires and New York.
"Oh, nice.",But I've done J-terms in Shanghai and Paris.
"Uh, nice! Did You like .. Which was your most favorite place of all of those places?","New York was definitely my most favorite place on earth and that's why I hope that in the future I'll be able to go back but I will have to sort out the visa issue and all that because I have... hum, I am a citizen of Moldova which is not the European Union so it will be tough to get a visa."
Inshallah,Thanks
hum ....,No Worries. Take your time.
How is the weather like in Moldova?,"In Moldova we have all types of weather. We have four seasons and it gets from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40. So we have a huge range and we experience all seasons - Summer, Fall, Winter Spring. So I miss that."
Okay. Do you think of going to other schools before coming to New York or Abu Dhabi?,"Funny enough I have only considered going to NYU Abu Dhabi. And since the application time was so early I applied right away in the first candidates weekend and I was planning that is if I do not get in and start thinking of other choices. But I was so lucky, I got in and I'm here now."
And how did you know about the place?,Of NYU Abu Dhabi?
Yes.,My brother used to know somebody who went here because they went through the same exchange program and actually my brother wanted to go here first but my parents were afraid of the situation in the Middle East for religious Eastern European Middle East parents they do not know that mucha and they were worried about their kids but once that guy graduated and it was my time to fly I got to ask him all the questions and I knew that it's safe and it's actually a great place to be so..
Nice. And Have your parents visit you here?,"Actually Yes to my my friends visited me last year in fall break. My brother and I saved us money to cover their flights and accommodation and we were able to bring them here because the salary discrepancy is huge. Between - you know, a small economy Moldova with what you make in her here so they wouldn't be able to come."
And did they like it here?,"They loved it! Yes, and they look for me so out of play and looking everywhere and making comments about things that I have never thought of. And it was it was fun. They were pretty kind and open minded about different cultures which I was very happy about that I didn't know how they would react so much."
And what about the food. Do you like the food here or...?,Do you mean if I like Arabic food or the NYUAD food.
"Hu.. no, the Arabic food.",Sometimes be a little more spicy than what I'm use to. And I have a very sensitive sense of taste and smell. So for me the foods that can be bland to you will be quite rich but something that would be normal to you is too spicy for me. But in general if I tone it down a bit it's very delicious.
And what's the cuisine like in Moldova?,So Moldova used to be part of Romania and the Russia - Soviet Union. So the foods are combined from all over the place. We have some Romanian food. We have some Russian food. I feel like even some Turkish things combined in there and so we eat a lot of soups and we eat a lot of grains like rice as well but cooked and not bland white. With something like prepared ... and the western food is everywhere.
"Do you miss the food, the Moldovian cuisine?",I used to more then now but now I got so used to just changing my diet depending where I am that I'm fine. And also I found some place where we can eat Russian food and the dining hall is also making Russian food from time to time... so I don't miss it that much.
And are you a coffee person or a tea person?,I love that question! hum.. Both! I love tea because you can drink it as much as you want and feels fancy. I love coffee for its taste and smell more than its properties to of keeping you awake - it doesn't work with me but it's all about taste and I love both.
It's nice. Have you tried Arabic coffee?,Yes. Arabic coffee is so strong for me so I have to dilute it. But it's very tasty and I love the tradition of - you know - small cups and stuff... I love it.
Well nice to meet you.,So nice to meet you too! Thanks for asking me questions!
